This algorithm is designed to analyze medium to large datasets and identify patterns and trends. It is based on a series of mathematical models and statistical analyses that allow it to accurately predict outcomes and provide valuable insights.

The outcome of a number of different ML and DL algorithms are compared here. Inputting more data examples would very likely improve the results. Overall, I believe that it works quite well for a relatively small dataset.

Acknowledgement: I appreciate the addition of XGBoost algorithm due to #rfjd.
