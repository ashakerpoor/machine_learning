<p>This algorithm is designed to analyze medium to large datasets and identify patterns and trends. It is based on a series of mathematical models and statistical analyses that allow it to accurately predict outcomes and provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>The outcome of several different ML and DL algorithms are compared here. Inputting more data examples would very likely improve the outcome of the results. Overall, I believe that it works quite well for a relatively small dataset.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement: I appreciate the addition of XGBoost algorithm due to #rfjd.</p>
